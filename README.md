# Prework - *About Dhamar*

Submitted by: **Dhamar Carrillo**

**About Dhamar** is an app that allows the user to learn more about the app creator, Dhamar, by revealing some hidden fun facts about her education and career. The user is also able to change the background color to a random color by clicking a button. In addition, if the user determines that the text color does not go well with the background color, they can choose the new text color using sliders that determine RGB values.  

Time spent: **9** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [x] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

- Instagram:
  - Algorithm is pretty accurate in recommnending posts in the same thread that are similar
  - Each post thread can be completely different from the one next to it; appeals to variety of user's interests
- Spotify
  - Displays lyrics in sync with the music
  - Recommends songs to add to a user's playlist or "enhances" the playlist
  - Can play music even when device is turned off
- Notion
  - Has a very clean interface and is easy to use
  - The code feature allows user to write code in a variety of different computer languages
  - Allows user to link and create new pages within other pages
- Garage Band
  - Can modify audio to different sounds and special effects
  - Allows user to save their song or audio as their phone ringtone
- Youtube
  - Algorithm is great at recommending new content based on user's interests
  - Plays a preview of a video if the user hovers over it on their device
  - New feature allows user to zoom in on the video

### App Idea

An app I'd like to develop would be a social media blocker. This app would mainly be targeted for those who struggle with social media addictions or simply want to spend less screen time on socials. The app would have to somehow access the user's phone settings. It'd keep track of the amount of screen time the user has spent on certain social media apps. Once the user has gone over a limit (which they themselves can set in the app's settings) the social media blocker will not allow them to go on the social media app again. If the user attempts to open social media, the social media blocker will instead give them a fun fact to learn about. The user would have 3 free-passes each day in which they can override the social media blocker if they *really* need to use social media after reaching their time limit. This app would work similar to the iOS screen time limit feature but it'd be slightly stricter (since the iOS feature allows users to unblock the opened app for 15 minutes, 1 hour, or all day). It'd also be more aesthetically pleasing and fun so that user's lose interest in going on social media. 


## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

The biggest challenge creating this app was allowing the user to assign their own colors to the text. I wanted to make the text color feature different than the background color button which just selected a random color. It was more challenging figuring out how to take in a user's input and convert it to RGB values.
